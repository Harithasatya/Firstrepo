An HTML document follows a specific structure that acts as the foundation for your web page:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Document</title>
  <link />
</head>
<body>
  <!-- your web page content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
Let's break it down:

<!DOCTYPE html>: defines the document type and version of HTML being used (HTML5 in this case).

<html lang="en"> and </html>: opening and closing tag of the root element that wraps the entire HTML content. The attribute lang="en" defines the language (in this case, USA English)

<head> and </head>: opening and closing tag of the head element contains meta-information <meta > about the HTML document, the page title <title></title> you see in the browser tab, and link <link /> which defines a link between your HTML document and an external resources, like stylesheet, favicon, import and so on.

<body> and </body> : opening and closing body tag encloses all the visible content of a web page, including text, images, links, forms, and other elements that users interact with.

Note: All HTML elements have opening (< >) and closing (</ >) tags, except for self-closing (< > or < />) tags, which I will explain in more detail later.

Comments
Notice this <!-- your web page content goes here --> in the above html basic structure, it's called comments. Comments are used to add explanatory notes that are not displayed when the web page is viewed in a browser. They are useful for documenting your code, providing information to other developers, or temporarily excluding specific parts of the code. You can create comment using this tag <!-- your comment goes here -->.

There are:

Single-line comment: <!-- This is a single-line comment -->
Multi-line comment: <!-- This is a multi-line comment. It can span multiple lines. All content within the comment block will be ignored by the browser. -->
Tags and Elements
HTML uses tags to define different elements on a webpage. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >). There are opening (< >) and closing (</ >) tags, and self-closing (< > or < />) tag. Here are a few examples:

Headings
<h1>This is a Heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is a Heading 2</h2>
<!-- ... up to <h6> -->
